## 🎮 **Deal or Disaster — Core Concept**

A fast‑paced, gamified real‑estate simulator where users evaluate **realistic distressed property scenarios** and decide whether each one is a *Deal* or a *Disaster*. Each scenario is crafted to teach a specific investing principle — from spotting hidden structural issues to calculating cash flow under pressure.

The game is intentionally **snappy, visual, and addictive**, designed to:

- Build confidence in evaluating deals
- Teach real-world investing skills
- Reduce fear of taking action
- Funnel users into deeper tools in your SaaS suite

This becomes your **flagship lead magnet** — fun enough to share, valuable enough to return to daily.

## 🧩 **Refined Core Gameplay Loop**

Each round presents a property card with:

- Address + 3–5 curated photos
- Asking price
- Estimated ARV
- Repair estimate *range* (forces judgment)
- Neighborhood score (schools, crime, comps)
- Hidden clues (e.g., “roof age unknown”)
- Optional countdown timer for “auction mode”

The player must:

1. **Review the property card**
2. **Tap Deal or Disaster**
3. **Choose 1–2 reasons why** (quick tap options)
4. **Reveal the truth** (actual ARV, real repair cost, cash flow, red flags)
5. **Get a score** (accuracy, reasoning, speed)
6. **Earn XP, badges, and unlocks**

This loop is short, satisfying, and highly repeatable.

## 🏚️ **Expanded Scenario Types**

To deepen learning and variety:

- **Cosmetic fixer** (easy win if repairs are cheap)
- **Structural nightmare** (foundation, roof, mold)
- **Title trouble** (liens, probate, tax issues)
- **Neighborhood mismatch** (great house, bad area)
- **Rental goldmine** (low repair, high rent)
- **Airbnb trap** (looks good, but zoning kills it)
- **Auction chaos** (limited info, high pressure)
- **Contractor scam** (repair estimate lies)
- **“Grandma house”** (dated but solid bones)

Each scenario teaches a specific investing lesson.
